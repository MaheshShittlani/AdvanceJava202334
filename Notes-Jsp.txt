1. JSP (JavaServer Pages) is a technology used for creating dynamic web pages in Java-based web applications.
2. It allows you to mix HTML markup and Java code to generate dynamic content.
3. JSP pages are processed by the web server before being sent to the client's browser.
4. JSP allows you to embed Java code within the HTML markup using special tags such as <% %>, <%= %>, and <%! %>. These tags are used to execute Java code, evaluate expressions, and define variables or methods.

Examples of implicit objects includes
    - request,
