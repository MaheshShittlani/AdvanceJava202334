What is the Web application?
-------------------------------
Web application is the collection of multiple web pages hosted on a server and any web page has its unique address(URI) with them it can be accessed.

What is the web page?
----------------------
Web pages are the piece of program that can be run over the browser throught the internet.

Types of web pages...
----------------------
    1. Static web pages
    2. Dynamic web pages

Static web pages...
---------------------
    Static pages are those that can't be changed automatically. It need to be changed manually.

    Generally static web pages are created with html, css.

Dynamic web pages....
------------------------
    It can be automatically changes (updated) by a program running in background.


Web application terminology
-----------------------------
1. Client - client is a person/pc/browser which is sending the request to acces the web page.

2. Server - is a machine or software program which provide the service or serve(host) your resources(files, images, program, data).

3. Web pages can be access by sending the `Request` to the server, server find the web pages, run some process if need and send the `Response`.

4. Request
-----------------
    - URI / URL
    - Request / HTTP Method (Get / Post)
    - Request Header
        - Platform (windows, linux, mobile)
        - user-agent: browser
        - ip-address: 
    - Request data / Request Body / Payload

5. Reponse
----------------
    - Status Code 
        - 200 - Success
        - 404 - Page not found (4XX)
        - 500 - Server side error (5XX)
    - Respons Header
    - Response Body / Response Data/ Payload

How static resources are processed?
--------------------------------------
    Static Reources - The files that don't need to process before sending to the client.
        - html files
        - css files
        - js files
        - images
        - pdf files
        - Audio / Video file

How dynamic pages are processed?
--------------------------------------
    Dynamic Resource - The files that should be processed before sending to the client.
        - Servlet
        - Jsp pages
    
Port
---------
    - Port is the unique idenfication of a server.
        - Web(http) server - 80(Apache)
                     - 8080 (Apache Tomcat)
        - Secure web server - https: 443
        - Mysql Server - 3306

Server
-----------
    - Web server (http server) -> Apache Tomcat
        - Servlet Container
        - JSP Container
    - Database Server (Data storage)




Servlet
------------
    What is the servlet?
    -----------------------
    1. Servlets are Java-based server-side components that dynamically generate web content and handle client requests.
    
    2. They provide a way to create dynamic web applications by extending the functionality of web servers.

    3. Servlets are part of the Java Servlet API, which is a specification that defines how servlets should behave and interact with the web server.

Installation of Tomcat
---------------------------
1. Tomcat home: C:/apache-tomcat
2. Important Jar
	-----------------
		- servlet-api.jar
		- jsp-api.jar
		- el-api.jar

3. Summary of tomcat directories
------------------------------------
1. bin: Contains the executable files and scripts for starting, stopping, and managing Tomcat server instances. It includes files like startup.bat (or startup.sh for Unix-based systems) and shutdown.bat (or shutdown.sh).

2. conf: Contains configuration files for Tomcat. The main file is server.xml, which configures the server-specific settings like ports, connectors, and global resources. Other files include web.xml for default web application settings and various XML files for configuring realms, security, and logging.


3. lib: Contains Java Archive (JAR) files required by Tomcat and its web applications. It includes Tomcat's own libraries and dependencies that provide additional functionality. You can also place third-party libraries in this directory that should be shared across multiple web applications.

4. logs: Contains log files generated by Tomcat, including catalina.out, which contains standard output and error messages. It also includes access logs, which record details about incoming requests and other log files for different components.

5. webapps: This directory is the default location for deploying web applications. Each web application is typically placed in a separate directory under the webapps directory. When Tomcat starts, it automatically deploys the web applications found in this directory.

6. work: Temporary directory used by Tomcat for storing compiled JSPs, cached classes, and other temporary files generated during runtime. It is recommended not to modify or delete files in this directory manually.

7. temp: Another temporary directory used by Tomcat for storing temporary files that are not related to specific web applications. It can include uploaded files, session data, and other temporary data. Like the work directory, it is advisable not to modify or delete files in this directory manually

--------------------------------------------

Servlet Life Cycle
--------------------------------------
The life cycle of a servlet refers to the series of stages that a servlet goes through, from its initialization to its destruction. 

1. **Initialization**: 
	During initialization, the servlet container creates an instance of the servlet and initializes it by calling the `init()` method. This method is called only once during the lifetime of the servlet. It is typically used to perform one-time setup tasks, such as loading configurations, establishing database connections, or initializing resources.

2. **Request Handling**: 
	Once the servlet is initialized, it is ready to handle client requests. For each incoming request, the servlet container calls the `service()` method of the servlet. The `service()` method determines the type of the request (GET, POST, etc.) and delegates the request to the appropriate method (`doGet()`, `doPost()`, etc.) based on the HTTP method.

3. **Request Processing**: 
	The servlet's request processing methods, such as `doGet()` and `doPost()`, handle the request-specific logic. These methods are responsible for processing the request parameters, performing business operations, generating dynamic content, and interacting with databases or other external resources.

4. **Response Generation**: 
	After the request processing is complete, the servlet generates the response to be sent back to the client. The response typically includes HTML content, JSON data, or other forms of output. The servlet sets the response headers, writes the response body, and may also perform redirects or set cookies.

5. **Destroying**: 
	The servlet container calls the `destroy()` method when it decides to remove the servlet from service. This typically occurs when the container is shutting down or when the servlet is being unloaded due to configuration changes or application redeployment. The `destroy()` method is used to release any resources held by the servlet, close database connections, or perform cleanup tasks.


Http Method
------------------
1. Get: doGet() - When get/feching the information from server.
2. Post: doPost() - When posting/storing information on to the server.
3. Put: doPut() - When updating detail
4. Patch: doPatch() - When small information of data is patched or updated.
5. Delete: doDelete() - Trying to delete the information 
6. Head: doHead()
7. Trace: doTrace()
8. Option: doOption()

-------------------------------------------
doGet(HttpRequest request, HttpResponse response)
-------------

HttpRequest Method
---------------------
1. String getMethod()
2. String getParameter(String key): Retrieves the value of a request parameter specified by its key. It is commonly used to access from data or query parameters sent with the request.
3. String[] getParamterValue(String key): Retrieves an array of values for a request parameter specified by its key. This method is used when a parameter can have multiple values, such as checkboxes with the same name.
    Example:
        <input type="checkbox" name="hobby" value="Cricket"> Cricket
        <input type="checkbox" name="hobby" value="Football"> Football
        <input type="checkbox" name="hobby" value="Music"> Music

4. ServletContext getServletContext(): Returns the `ServletContext` associated with the servlet. ServletContext is a class which holds all the information related to the application environment.
        Example#1:
            ServletContext application = request.getServletContext();
            applicaiton.getRealPath('\WEB-INF\subscriber.txt);
                    OR
            String path = request.getServletContext().getRealPath('\WEB-INF\subscriber.txt");
        Example#2:
            RequestDispatcher dispather = request.getRequestDispatcher(String path);

5. void setAttribute(String key, Object data): Add some addition attribute into the request. But Important note is that the attribute lifecycle will be limited to the request.
6. Object getAttribute(String key): Fetch the attribute value.

RequestDispatcher: The RequestDispatcher interface in Java Servlet provides a way to forward a request from one servlet to another servlet or include the response of another servlet in the current response. It enables servlets to collaborate and share data during request processing.

    forward(request, response)
    include(request, response)

response
--------------
    void sendRedirect(String path):
        it send the response with the status code 302 and location header to the browser(client) so that client can redirect the request.
    Example:
        response.sendRedirect('subscriberDetail.jsp');

---------------------------

Setting The error page / exception handler in configuration (web.xml)
-------------------------------------------------------
<web-app>
    <!-- Other configuration elements -->
    
    <error-page>
        <exception-type>java.lang.Exception</exception-type>
        <location>/errorPage.jsp</location>
    </error-page>
    
    <error-page>
        <error-code>404</error-code>
        <location>/notFound.jsp</location>
    </error-page>
    
    <!-- Other error-page mappings -->
</web-app>

Initialization Parameter
--------------------------
Initialization parameters in servlets allow you to pass configuration values to your servlet at the time of initialization. 

These parameters can be defined in the deployment descriptor (web.xml) or using annotations. 

Initialization parameters provide a way to configure the behavior of your servlet without modifying its code. Here are the ways to define initialization parameters in a servlet:

Using web.xml (Deployment Descriptor):
---------------------------------------
In the web.xml file, you can define initialization parameters for a servlet using the <init-param> element within the <servlet> element. Here's an example:

<web-app>
  <!-- Other configuration elements -->
  <servlet>
    <servlet-name>MyServlet</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>com.example.MyServlet</servlet-class>
    <init-param>
      <param-name>param1</param-name>
      <param-value>value1</param-value>
    </init-param>
    <init-param>
      <param-name>param2</param-name>
      <param-value>value2</param-value>
    </init-param>
  </servlet>
  <!-- Other servlet mappings -->
</web-app>


Using Annotations:
----------------------
With the Servlet API 3.0 and above, you can also use annotations to define initialization parameters directly in your servlet class. Here's an example:

@WebServlet(name = "MyServlet", urlPatterns = { "/myservlet","/myserve" },
            initParams = {
                @WebInitParam(name = "param1", value = "value1"),
                @WebInitParam(name = "param2", value = "value2")
            })
public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {
    // Servlet code goes here
}

Retrieve Init Parameter
------------------------------
To access the initialization parameters within the servlet, you can use the getInitParameter() method of the ServletConfig object. For example:


public void init(ServletConfig config) throws ServletException {
    super.init(config);
    
    String param1 = config.getInitParameter("param1");
    String param2 = config.getInitParameter("param2");
    
    // Use the initialization parameters
}

Context parameter
--------------------------
Context parameters, also known as servlet context parameters or application-wide parameters, allow you to define global configuration values for your entire web application. These parameters are accessible to all servlets, filters, and other components within the application. Context parameters are useful when you need to share common configuration values across multiple servlets or components.


Using web.xml (Deployment Descriptor):
-----------------------------------------

<web-app>
  <!-- Other configuration elements -->
  <context-param>
    <param-name>param1</param-name>
    <param-value>value1</param-value>
  </context-param>
  <context-param>
    <param-name>param2</param-name>
    <param-value>value2</param-value>
  </context-param>
</web-app>

public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {
    ServletContext context = request.getServletContext();
    
    String param1 = context.getInitParameter("param1");
    String param2 = context.getInitParameter("param2");
    
    // Use the context parameters
}
